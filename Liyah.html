  <h1>Practicing my coding</h1>
		
		<p><font size="4">I basically made this to practice my code and to hopefully make you feel better because you did say you’re not feeling okay because of your period. So I made this little yap session about my day which was boring because there’s no return flights from Cape Town, which is hella annoying but anyways I’m still in jhb unfortunately. But I just watched soccer which I’m gonna do again and played some games. Also there’s this 2 player game I want us to play, it’s a murder mystery type game if you wanna call tho so yea.</font></p>
